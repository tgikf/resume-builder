# Resume Builder

Experimenting (i.e., struggling) with Microsoft Word and online design tools, I had a hard time coming up with appealing yet space-efficient resume layouts. Hence, I came up with a simple React-based one-page resume generator.

Not only does it help me keep my own resume neat, it's also come in really handy when friend's ask me for my resume template. That being said, it's far from perfect and might or might not struggle to adapt to long content. My apologies to the long-named ones.
